pcgen-rules
===========

pcgen-rules is an attempt to extract the rules and data from [PCGen](http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/01_overview.php) and make them more accessible to other programs.

You will need the PCGen data files in a separate directory. Edit the `Makefile` accordingly if you use a directory other than `data/`.

Currently the code just parses .pcc and .lst files; this is very much a work in progress.
