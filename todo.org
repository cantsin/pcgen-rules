* loading comment from pcgen-dev ml
The "load" process is - in practice - not much different than the
process used to compile software. (Preprocessing is the handling of
the PCC files and recursive calls to PCC:, compilation is handling the
.COPY, .MOD, and parsing the tokens. The symbol table is effectively
the data stored in the ReferenceContext, the other parts of the AST
are effectively the contents of ListContext and ObjectContext). Just
like a compiler has multiple passes over the internal representation,
so do we, as we have to resolve references back to the original
objects. (We effectively have 4 passes if you ignore the recursive PCC
file resolution)
